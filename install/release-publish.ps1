# Publish a release: bump the patch, build the release exe, and put it on GitHub.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install\release-publish.ps1
#
# This is the desktop shell's *delivery* — the sibling of the two Android shells'
# scripts\release-publish.ps1, and the same shape: the patch is bumped, the
# artifact is built, the bump lands as its own commit, and `gh release create`
# attaches what was built. `just deploy-workshop` is the other door a release
# leaves by (this machine's C:\workshop), and it advances the version too: the two
# are independent acts, not two halves of one, which is why a version can move
# without a GitHub release existing for it and the other way round.
#
# Two assets, because this app is installed two ways and both come from the one
# exe:
#
#   * Quire-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe — install\build-installer.ps1's Inno
#     Setup program: per-user, no elevation, and uninstalling leaves the library
#     alone. quire.iss reads the version out of the exe's own version resource,
#     which build.rs stamps from [package] version.
#   * Quire-<version>-windows-x64.zip — the portable single file `just dist`
#     packages, for someone who would rather not install anything.
#
# The steps are ordered so nothing ships without its bookkeeping:
#
#   1. [package] version's patch +1 in Cargo.toml. The bump has to precede the
#      build: build.rs generates the exe's version resource from CARGO_PKG_VERSION,
#      and the installer's own file name and AppVersion are read from that
#      resource — so a publish that built before the bump would publish the
#      previous version under a new tag.
#   2. `cargo build --release --bin quire`, then ask the exe to confirm it took
#      the bump. A stale exe reports the previous version here; `NotAttempted` (no
#      rc.exe on this machine) leaves the block empty, and an empty value is a
#      soft miss rather than a failed publish, the way build.rs treats it.
#   3. The two assets. The installer first, because it is the one that can fail
#      for a reason that has nothing to do with this repository (Inno Setup is
#      not installed) — and it must fail before a push, not after.
#   4. The bump is committed (Cargo.toml + Cargo.lock, nothing else) and pushed,
#      so the tag created next points at a commit carrying the version it names.
#   5. `gh release create v<version>` attaches both files. Re-running after a
#      failed publish finds the tag already there and re-uploads over it rather
#      than erroring out. Needs `gh` signed in.
#
# One rule for the text below: every character inside a Write-Output or a throw
# is ASCII. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less script as ANSI — this file is
# UTF-8 like the rest of the repository — so a non-ASCII character in a *string
# literal* reaches the console as mojibake (measured: an em dash came out as
# "鈥?", and this machine's codepage is GBK). Comments are free; messages are
# not, because the one place they are read is a publish that went wrong.

Quire $version for Windows x64: a local, GPU-accelerated, Notion-like document
workspace in one process (Rust + Slint) - nothing to install alongside it.

Two ways in, both in this release:

- **Quire-$version-windows-x64-setup.exe** installs per-user (no elevation, no
  admin prompt), and uninstalling never touches your notes.
- **Quire-$version-windows-x64.zip** is the portable build: unzip it and run
  quire.exe. Nothing else is needed beside it.

Your library is a single SQLite file at %APPDATA%\Quire\quire.db - the same
folder name the Android shells use, so a library moves between them. `--portable`
and `--db <path>` move it on purpose.

Requires Windows 10+ (x64). See CHANGELOG.md for what is in this build.
