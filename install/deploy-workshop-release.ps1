# Deploy a release into the workshop's archive: one folder per release,
# C:\workshop\quire-slint-<version>\quire-slint-<version>.exe.
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install\deploy-workshop.ps1
#
# The workshop directory holds one folder per release, named <name>-<version>
# (aura-1.2.6, aw-qtui-0.1.36), filled with what that build needs to run. Quire's
# release exe is self-contained — dist.ps1 zips the one file and nothing beside
# it — so its folder is that one exe alone.
#
# The version is in the file's own name, not only in the folder's, because the
# file leaves the folder: it gets copied out, opened in a properties tab, sent to
# someone. A generic `quire.exe` says nothing about which renderer build it is
# once it is beside another `quire.exe`, and FileVersion is one dialog away rather
# than in the shell's own listing.
#
# The name is `quire-slint`, not the manifest's `quire`: the workshop is where
# this drops beside *other* applications, and the two shells this repository has
# (quire-desktop, quire-droid) are two builds of one application that ship on
# different days. A bare `quire-<version>` would read as one application in a
# list that already holds one folder per release of several, with nothing saying
# which shell made it.
#
# This recipe used to keep a second destination — the in-place install at
# C:\workshop\quire-desktop\quire.exe — and every deploy overwrote it, which is
# why the old flow asked any instance running there to quit first (ADR-0105's
# channel). That install path is gone (ADR-0139): the archive folder is new
# every release, so nothing is ever overwritten and no running instance is ever
# in the way. The workshop is a record of what was built; it is not where the
# app is run from, and a folder that a deploy fought a running exe for was
# exactly the folder that never should have held one.
#
# `just deploy-workshop` is the entry point, and this script is the whole flow.
# The steps are ordered so the folder holds a binary that says <version>:
#
#   1. [package] version's patch +1 in Cargo.toml. The folder is named after the
#      version, so this is what makes a deploy *land*: without it the archive
#      would be rewritten by the same build.
#   2. `cargo build --release --bin quire-slint`. The bump has to come first for more
#      than the folder name: build.rs generates the exe's version resource block from
#      CARGO_PKG_VERSION — the number the file properties tab shows — so a build
#      that runs before the bump carries the old version. That is why the build
#      lives here rather than in the recipe.
#   3. The bump is committed (Cargo.toml + Cargo.lock, nothing else) and pushed,
#      the way every repository in this workspace is left: the commit is the
#      record of what each folder in the workshop was built from.
#   4. target\release\quire-slint.exe is copied into the version folder under the
#      versioned name, so the file carries the number the folder is named for.
#
# One rule for the text below: every character inside a Write-Output or a throw
# is ASCII. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less script as ANSI — this file is
# UTF-8 like the rest of the repository — so a non-ASCII character in a *string
# literal* reaches the console as mojibake (measured: an em dash came out as
# "鈥?", and this machine's codepage is GBK). Comments are free; messages are
# not, because the one place they are read is a deploy that went wrong.
